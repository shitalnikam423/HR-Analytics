OBJECTIVE
Employee attrition is the rate at which employees leave a company. The goal of this analysis is to model employee attrition and determine the most dominant contributing factors that govern this turnover. Through this kind of analysis, we can understand how many employees are likely to leave, while also determining which employees are at the highest risk and for what reasons.
